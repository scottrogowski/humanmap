All of the source code to generate http://humanmap.org is in here for hacking purposes.

To generate events:
./events_processor.py path/to/big_wikipedia_dump.xml

This code was based off of an earlier project done here http://www.ragtag.info/2011/feb/2/history-world-100-seconds/
The code for that is here https://github.com/gareth-lloyd/visualizing-events
